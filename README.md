# Cyber Security Tools for the Cyber Adventurer

This repository holds different scripts authored by either myself or magnificent people out there in the community. I didn't have a better way to centralize all the wizardry that incident responders invoke daily to help protect organizations from the dastards that find joy in deploying ransomware to hospitals and charities. Damn those guys. 

As Foucault said, paraphrasing and inverting Carl von Clausewitz *"politics is the continuation of war by other means"*, this repo is dedicated to tactical cyber tradecraft to equip the cyber warrior with the tools needed in this digital warfare.
